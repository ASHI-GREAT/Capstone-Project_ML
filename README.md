# Capstone Project--Prediction_Oil/Gas-production-

This is a Machine learning model built to predict the production rate of oil and gas of certain no of wells during a period of time

The dataset has been sourced from data.world, a   platform providing public datasets for data analysis and machine learning projects.
This dataset contains production information from oil and gas wells in New York State from 1967 to 1999. Each record represents a sum by operator for each county, town, field, and formation grouping.
